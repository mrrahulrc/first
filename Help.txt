You can set a local branch to follow (get data from) the remote branch by following command:
git branch --set-upstream-to origin/feature_1

In order to push the changes you need to use below command
git push -u origin feature_1_local:feature_1
git push -u origin <local_branch>:<remote_branch>

In my case I had local branch feature_1_local
and remote branch called feature_1
